Assume input is a Prism File
Parsing R{"attacks"}max=? [F s11=2 ]
Load model from prism file
Load formula Rmax=? [F s11=2 ] with respect to program.
Call stormpy for constraints
Build model
Built a model with 761 states and 5009 transitions
Bisimulation yields model with 761 states, 2606 actions and 5009 transitions
Stormpy finished collecting constraints
Push [1]
Call Z3 cli tool with timeout 10.0
SMT result:	unsat
Load formula Rmax=? [F s11=2 ] with respect to program.
