Assume input is a Prism File
Parsing Pmin=? [ F "finished" & "all_coins_equal_1" ]
Load model from prism file
Load formula Pmin=? [ F "finished" & "all_coins_equal_1" ] with respect to program.
Call stormpy for constraints
Build model
Built a model with 22656 states and 75232 transitions
Bisimulation yields model with 22656 states, 60544 actions and 75232 transitions
Stormpy finished collecting constraints
Push [1]
Call Z3 cli tool with timeout 10.0
SMT result:	unsat
Load formula Pmin=? [ F "finished" & "all_coins_equal_1" ] with respect to program.
Sampling assumes (without any checks) that the point is welldefined
Call stormpy for sampling
