Assume input is a Prism File
Parsing Pmax=? [ F (s=5 & T) ]
Load model from prism file
Load formula Pmax=? [ F (s=5 & T) ] with respect to program.
Call stormpy for constraints
Build model
Built a model with 18369 states and 24950 transitions
Bisimulation yields model with 18369 states, 18510 actions and 24950 transitions
Stormpy finished collecting constraints
Push [1]
Call Z3 cli tool with timeout 10.0
SMT result:	unsat
Load formula Pmax=? [ F (s=5 & T) ] with respect to program.
Sampling assumes (without any checks) that the point is welldefined
Call stormpy for sampling
