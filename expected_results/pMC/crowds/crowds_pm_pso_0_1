Assume input is a Prism File
Parsing P=? [F "observe0Greater1" ]
Load model from prism file
Load formula P=? [F "observe0Greater1" ] with respect to program.
Call stormpy for constraints
Build model
Built a model with 104512 states and 246082 transitions
Bisimulation yields model with 104512 states, 104512 actions and 246082 transitions
Perform bisimulation
Bisimulation yields model with 80 states, 80 actions and 120 transitions
Stormpy finished collecting constraints
Push [1]
Call Z3 cli tool with timeout 10.0
SMT result:	unsat
Load formula P=? [F "observe0Greater1" ] with respect to program.
Sampling assumes (without any checks) that the point is welldefined
Call stormpy for sampling
