Assume input is a Prism File
Parsing P=? [ F s=5 ]
Load model from prism file
Load formula P=? [ F s=5 ] with respect to program.
Call stormpy for constraints
Build model
Built a model with 39432 states and 53251 transitions
Bisimulation yields model with 39432 states, 39432 actions and 53251 transitions
Perform bisimulation
Bisimulation yields model with 20999 states, 20999 actions and 29703 transitions
Stormpy finished collecting constraints
Push [1]
Call Z3 cli tool with timeout 10.0
SMT result:	unsat
Load formula P=? [ F s=5 ] with respect to program.
Sampling assumes (without any checks) that the point is welldefined
Call stormpy for sampling
Sampling with stormpy successfully finished
