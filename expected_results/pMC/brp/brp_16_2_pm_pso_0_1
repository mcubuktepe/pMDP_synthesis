Assume input is a Prism File
Parsing P=? [ F s=5 ]
Load model from prism file
Load formula P=? [ F s=5 ] with respect to program.
Call stormpy for constraints
Build model
Built a model with 613 states and 803 transitions
Bisimulation yields model with 613 states, 613 actions and 803 transitions
Perform bisimulation
Bisimulation yields model with 324 states, 324 actions and 452 transitions
Stormpy finished collecting constraints
Push [1]
Call Z3 cli tool with timeout 10.0
SMT result:	unsat
Load formula P=? [ F s=5 ] with respect to program.
Sampling assumes (without any checks) that the point is welldefined
Call stormpy for sampling
Sampling with stormpy successfully finished
