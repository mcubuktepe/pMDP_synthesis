Assume input is a Prism File
Parsing P=? [F "target" ]
Load model from prism file
Load formula P=? [F "target" ] with respect to program.
Call stormpy for constraints
Build model
Built a model with 8112 states and 11577 transitions
Bisimulation yields model with 8112 states, 8112 actions and 11577 transitions
Perform bisimulation
Bisimulation yields model with 5447 states, 5447 actions and 7374 transitions
Stormpy finished collecting constraints
Push [1]
Call Z3 cli tool with timeout 10.0
SMT result:	unsat
Load formula P=? [F "target" ] with respect to program.
Sampling assumes (without any checks) that the point is welldefined
Call stormpy for sampling
